    <h1>Privacy Policy — Invozo</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: August 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Invozo</strong> (the "App") handles information when
        you use the app to create fuel bills, recharge receipts, book invoices, gym bills, and rent
        receipts. Invozo is designed to be privacy-friendly and works primarily on your device.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Invozo collects minimal information. Most information stays on your device unless you
        explicitly export or share a document.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local document data:</strong> Invoice/receipt fields you enter (names, amounts,
            dates, vehicle numbers, item lists, etc.) are stored locally on your device.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Optional e-signature:</strong> E-signatures are supported only for rent
            receipts. When you create a rent receipt and add an e-signature, the signature image is
            saved locally as part of that receipt.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Export & Sharing:</strong> When you export, save to a file, or share a document,
            the exported file contains the data you created and will be handled by your chosen
            sharing method (email, messaging apps, cloud storage). These exports are outside the
            control of Invozo once shared.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect or transmit your documents, receipts, or e-signatures to our
            servers.
        </li>
        <li>We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties.</li>
        <li>We do NOT collect analytics, usage telemetry, or tracking data by default.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network & Cloud (Optional)</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use an explicit cloud export or backup feature in the future, the app will
        clearly request permission and explain what will be uploaded. In the current version, no
        automatic cloud backup or sync is performed.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage / Files (Optional):</strong> Required only if you export receipts to a
            local file or import a template. This permission is used solely to read/write files you
            specify.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Internet (Optional):</strong> Not required for core features. If present for
            optional features (like updates), it is not used to upload your receipts.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All data created and stored by Invozo stays on your device unless you explicitly share or
        export it. We recommend using device-level security (screen lock, backups) to protect your
        data. The app does not transmit personal data to remote servers in the current release.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>Documents you create remain on your device until you delete them. If you export or share a
        document, retention is subject to the destination you choose (for example, your email or
        cloud storage provider).</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Invozo is not intended for use by children under 13. If you believe a child has provided
        personal information, please contact support to request removal instructions.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app. If we add features that
        change data handling (for example, cloud backups), we will notify users inside the app and
        update this page with a clear changelog and effective date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests about your data or this policy, please contact us at:
        <strong>support@invozo.example</strong> (replace with your real support email).</p>
